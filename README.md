#discord bot with deepseek v3 as main ai model

i made this easy bot cuz why not and i just wanna check if this will really work.

#first of all you need is download all libaries i used

```
pip install -r requirements.txt (for win)

pip3 install -r requirements.txt (for linux and macos)
```

#then you need to create .env file with your discord token

```
cp expample.env .env
```

#now you can run the bot

```
python3 src/bot.py
```

#now you can use it for your discord server. 

#VERY BIG NOTICE.
this bot made to talk on russian, but if you wanna change language you need to change system prompt in src/ryuka_personality.py
